> A work in progress next generation of redis client for Node.js. A modern, ultra performant and feature rich implementation.

## Planned Features

### Connectors

 - [x] Standalone
 - [ ] Sentinel
 - [ ] Cluster
 - [ ] Need something custom? The standalone connector is built to be extended upon, both Sentinel and Cluster connectors extend from Standalone - so you can do the same for your custom connection / command routing logic.
 
### Prefixing

- [ ] String or Function key prefixing
- [ ] String or Function pubsub event prefixing

### Extensibility

- [ ] Build custom Hooks to extend/provide functionality
- [ ] Advanced custom LUA scripting functionality
- [ ] Human friendly PUBSUB, losely based on node's Event Emitter API

`Features list is WIP. Make an issue for any other features you'd like to see.`
